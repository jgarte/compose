# compose

The compose program provides a custom DSL for composing music with
[twelve-tone rows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_row).

The composer composes by specifying integers 0 through 11 exactly once
on each line.

Each line delimits a twelve-tone row and therefore any given line
cannot contain more or less than 12 notes per line.

Files interpreted by the compose program have a file ending of `.comp`.

Below is an example of valid input for one line:

```
1 5 4 4 1 5 3 4 5 3 6
```

An example input file has been included called `music.comp`.

More examples of tone rows can be found on this page or compose your own üçé:
